#### Panic in the kitchen: The cooking game
``` Made in Unity3D (c#) ```

Panic in the kitchen is a cooking game were you have to make as much hamburgers in 1 minute. This was a school project were we had some constraints, our constraint was that the game needs to last only 1 minute. 

I did alot of programming for the game and some design stuff.
