### Jesper Enschede's portfolio.
> Welcome to my portfolio, This git-repo contains all my school project, fun side project and other video game development stuff that i'm proud of.

#### Panic in the kitchen: The cooking game
``` Made in Unity3D (c#) ```

Panic in the kitchen is a cooking game were you have to make as much hamburgers in 1 minute. This was a school project were we had some constraints, our constraint was that the game needs to last only 1 minute. 

I did alot of programming for the game and some design stuff.

#### Semiconductor tycoon
``` Made in Unity3D (c#) ```

Semiconductor tycoon is a game were you have to build your own semiconductor empire. This was a school project made for trimm!

I did most of the back-end coding for this game and a little bit of the design aspects.
